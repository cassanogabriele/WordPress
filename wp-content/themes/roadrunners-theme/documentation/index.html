			<p>Installing WordPress on your web server is easy. Each web host is different but 
			when you log in to your dashboard there's usually an option that allows you
			to install WordPress automatically. In the unlikely event that your web host does not have this option, you can
			follow this guide from the WordPress codex, which gives more detailed information
			on how to install WordPress on your web server, or locally on your machine.</p>

			<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress</a></p>
			
			<div class="note">
				<p><strong>Important: </strong>Since this theme uses the latest features of WordPress,
				be sure to upgrade to the latest version once you have installed it. The latest version
				is 3.8 as of writing, though it has been thoroughly tested on 3.9 (beta).</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="tip">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you would like to install WordPress locally on your

		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			
			<p>After you've installed WordPress and upgraded to the latest version (highly recommended),
			you are now ready to install RoadRunners. You can do this one of two ways, I'll start
			with the first which is the easiest;</p>
			
			<h2>The Quick and Easy Way</h2>
			<p>After you have downloaded the ZIP package from Themeforest, you will need
			to extract all the files first. If your computer does not have any tools
			to do this, you can use <a href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm" target="_blank">WinZip</a>, 
			<a href="http://7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>, 
			or <a href="http://winace.com/" target="_blank">WinAce</a>.</p>
			<p>Next, log in to your WordPress dashboard and navigate your way to the 
			<strong>Themes</strong> page:</p>
			<img src="images/install-01.jpg" alt="Themes Page" />
			<p>Now click on "Add New Theme":</p>
			<img src="images/install-02.jpg" alt="Add New Theme" />
			<p>This will take you to the "Install Themes" page. From here, click on Upload:</p>
			<img src="images/install-03.jpg" alt="Click on Upload" />
			<p>You can now browse your computer and find where you extracted the
			download package. You will need to find and select the file "roadrunners-theme.zip".
			(It needs to be the ZIP file and NOT the folder) and then click on "Install Now":</p>
			<img src="images/install-04.jpg" alt="Upload File" />
			<p>From here you will have a choice to either return to the Dashboard, or 
			Preview your site with the new your theme installed. If you choose "preview",
			you can customize some of the settings such as the background colour or 
			background image. If you choose to do this, make sure you activate the theme by
			clicking on "save".</p>
			
			<div class="tip">
				<p>If you are using WordPress 3.9, it is now possible to manage your widgets in the preview too!</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>And that's it! RoadRunners should now be installed on your WordPress site. If, for
			some reason, you are having difficulties, there is an alternative way...</p>
			
			<h2>The Alternative Way</h2>
			<p>Along with the ZIP file of the theme, there is also an unzipped version which
			is a stand alone folder named "roadrunners". If you have access to your web server
			via an FTP client such as FileZilla, you can upload the "roadrunners"
			theme folder directly. All you need to do is upload the folder into the "themes" directory.
			The path to the themes directory is usually as follows:</p>
			<pre>http://www.yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/</pre>
			<p>Once you have done this, you can proceed through the step below to activate the theme.</p>
			<img src="images/activate.jpg" alt="Activate Theme" />
			
		</div>
		<hr>
		
		<div id="child-theme" class="section-heading sixteen columns">
			<h1>D - Creating a Child Theme</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
		
		<div class="sixteen columns">
		
			<p><strong>Note that as of V1.1.0, a child theme now comes with the main theme and can be found inside
			the download package!</strong></p>
			
			<p>If you plan on modifying any of the code for RoadRunners once you've installed it, it's always a good idea
			to create a "Child Theme" to work with instead. If you work with the theme directly and decide
			to modify any of its code, then when a newer version of the theme is released, all of your changes
			will be overwritten. Below is a brief example of how you begin this process</p>
			<img src="images/child-01.jpg" alt="Child Theme Folder Structure" />
			
			<p>Inside this new folder, create a new file called <strong>style.css</strong>. This is the only file
			required to make a Child Theme. Within this new CSS file, you will need to have the following code:</p>
			<img src="images/child-02.jpg" alt="Child CSS File" />
			
			<p>Now all of your changes in this file will override the original stylesheets from the parent theme. The same
			rule applys to any of the files you need to change. Simply create a new file of the same name and edit away!
			There are more detailed instructions on how to create a Child Theme
			over at the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">WordPress codex</a>. </p>

			<h1>E - Custom Header &amp; Background</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
		
		<div class="sixteen columns">
		
			<p>As well as a Theme Options panel, RoadRunners also supports some of WordPress' extra
			customization features, like the background customizer. You can edit this
			by going into the WordPress dashboard, and navigating to the <strong>Appearance</strong>
			side menu.</p>
			<img src="images/customize.jpg" alt="Customize Menu" />
			
			<p>From here you can change the background and also choose
			to have a colour or image for the main body's background.</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Header Image is now configurable in the Theme Options
				panel.</p>

		<div id="install-plugins" class="section-heading sixteen columns">
			<h1>F - Installing the Plugins</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			
			<p>There are some Plugins you can install that will extend the use of the RoadRunners theme. One of them
			was included in the download package when you bought the theme (roadrunners-plugin.zip), and the
			the other two are optional plugins: <strong>The Breadcrumbs Plugin</strong> by Justin Tadlock, and <strong>Contact Form 7</strong>
			by Takayuki Miyoshi. When you installed the theme, you will have been prompted to install these plugins. You can then let the
			theme install these plugins for you, or you can install them yourself as described below.</p>
			
			<h2>RoadRunners Plugin</h2>
			<p>This Plugin lets you create and manage your events and artists, and also has a small selection of useful shortcodes to use (more on this below).</p>
			<p>Installing a plugin is very similar to installing a theme. You simply need
			to upload the plugin in a ZIP format; From the WordPress dashboard, navigate your way to
			the plugins page and click on "add new":</p>
			<img src="images/plugin-01.jpg" alt="Plugin Add New" />
			
			<p>In the same directory as the theme's ZIP file, you will have noticed the "roadrunners-plugin.zip"
			file. This is the file you need to upload. Again, this is very similar to the way you
			installed the theme:</p>
			<img src="images/plugin-02.jpg" alt="Upload Plugin" />	
			<img src="images/plugin-03.jpg" alt="Install Plugin" />
			
			<p>As mentioned earlier, the theme itself will prompt you to install these plugins so you shouldn't need to
			worry about doing it manually. If you do, you can repeat these steps for the other plugins, but instead of uploading
			them, you'll need to do a search. Search for "breadcrumb trail" and "contact form 7" and you'll be able to install them 
			directly from the WordPress Plugin Repository. When you have all plugins downloaded and installed. Make sure you
			activate them!</p>
			<img src="images/plugin-04.jpg" alt="Activate Plugin" />
			
			<p>To confirm that you have the plugins installed and working porperly, you should have these extra menu items
			in the sidebar on your WordPress admin dashboard.</p>
			<img src="images/menu.jpg" alt="Menu Items" />			
			
			<p>All your plugins are ready to go! And don't forget, if you ever wanted to
			change themes, you can take all of the plugin content with you. Thats the 
			great thing about using plugins! Don't forget, the above plugins are only meant to enhance your experience,
			you don't need them for the theme to function properly. More information about how to use these plugins are described further
			down this document.</p>

			<h1>G - Importing Demo Data</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns">
		
			<p>If you liked the demo site for RoadRunners, you'll be pleased to know that the data is available
			as an XML file for you to import into your WordPress site. This can be found in the "demo-data" folder along
			with a text file that has all the theme options data too. This is a brief guide on how to import the data.
			Before we start, it is important to note that you should install all of the recommended plugins in order
			to get all of the data. Also, the images have been replaced with dummy images for licensing reasons. If you
			would like these images, they can be purchased from photodune.net</p>
			<p>First, go to your WordPress dashboard and navigate your way to the <strong>Tools -> Import</strong> page
			from the side menu. On this page, there is an option for you to import content from another system. Click
			on the WordPress option:</p>
			<img src="images/import-01.jpg" alt="Import Page" /> 
			
			<p>Now all you need to do is click on "Browse" and find the file named "wordpress-demo-data.xml" then
			click on "Upload File and Import". Be sure to check the box that says "Download Attachments". The process
			may take a little while, so go and make yourself a cup of tea :)</p>
			<img src="images/import-02.jpg" alt="Theme Options" />
			
			<p>All of the demo posts and pages should now be available in addition to the content you already have
			on your site. Now we just need to import the theme options data. To do this, return to your WordPress
			dashboard and navigate to the Theme Options page and go to the Import and Export menu:</p>
			<img src="images/import-03.jpg" alt="Theme Options Data" />
			
			<p>As stated in the screenshot above, enter all the text from the "roadrunners-options-data.txt" file (this is
			in the same folder as the "wordpress-demo-data.xml" file) and click the "Import Options" button. The text you see will look
			like gibberish, thats okay it just means that its encoded.</p>

		<div id="events" class="section-heading sixteen columns">
			<h1>H - Managing Your Events &amp; Artists</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			
			<p>The RoadRunners Plugin provides you with two extra post types, one for Events and one for Artists.
			The Events post type lets you store information like venues, event dates, and a map to display the
			location. Instead of categories, you have event types which could include festivals, charity gigs and so on.
			With the Artists post type you can store information relating to individual musicians or bands. This information could include
			a list of albums and upcoming albums. You can organise these into different music genres too, like Rock, Jazz, or Metal.</p>
			<p>If you are already familiar with writing posts in WordPress, then adding Events and Artists is almost exactly the
			same. The only real difference is that your Events and Artists have a few optional extra fields to fill in, such as
			a date or venue for Events, and discography or upcoming albums for Artists. This information is displayed on the front
			end whenever a user visits an Event or Artist.</p>
			
			<h2>Events Fields</h2>
			<img src="images/events-fields.jpg" alt="Events Fields" />
			<p>These are the extra fields that are available for the <strong>Events</strong> custom post type. As you can see, they
			are all pretty self explanetory. The only thing to note, is the map location field. This must be an iFrame generated by Google
			Maps or something similar. The width and height attributes doesn't matter as the theme will resize the frame to fit its 
			container.</p>
			
			<h2>Artists Fields</h2>
			<img src="images/artists-fields.jpg" alt="Artists Fields" />
			<p>These are the extra fields that are available for the <strong>Artists</strong> custom post type. These are also straightforward,
			and you can even use some basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> like in the screenshot above.</p>

		<div id="shortcodes" class="section-heading sixteen columns">
			<h1>I - Using the Shortcodes</h1><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
		</div>
	
		<div class="sixteen columns">
			
			<p>With the RoadRunners Plugin
			activated, you will also be able to use
			some shortcodes when editing posts and pages. Below, you will
			find a full list of all available shortcodes along with their
			usage and purpose.</p>
			
			<div class="note">
				<p>Although you can use these shortcodes in any theme, they may
				look different due to the theme's styling.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Column Shortcodes</h2>
			<p>These will allow you arrange your content into columns.
			There are many perameters you can use to control the layout
			not just on desktop, but for Mobile and Tablet displays.
			Example usage:</p>
			
<pre>
[col grid="50"]

Your content...

[/col]
</pre>
		
			<p>The example above will create a column that is 50% the
			width of it's parent container. You can specify the percentage
			in increments of five (e.g. 25, 30, 35, 75 etc.) or, if you
			need a column that takes up a third of it's parent, you can
			use 33, or 66 for two thirds. Here's a more advanced example:</p>

<pre>
[col grid="25" tgrid="50" mgrid="100"]

Your Content...

[/col]
</pre>

			<p>This will display the column at twenty five percent on a desktop
			display, fifty percent (half) on a Tablet display and one hundred percent
			(full) on a Mobile display. you can also hide columns on specific
			devices like so:</p>
			
<pre>
[col grid="100" thide="true" mhide="true"]

Your Content...

[/col]
</pre>
			
			<p>This will simply hide the content when viewed on a Tablet and Mobile
			device. There are many more ways to display columns including using
			"Prefix" and "Suffix" which are the equivilant to using empty columns.
			Here's an example:</p>
			
<pre>
[col pre="25" col="50" suf="25"]

Your Content...

[/col]
</pre>
		
			<p>This example will create an empty column that is twenty five percent
			(one quarter) wide, followed by a column that is fifty percent (one half) wide
			which will have all of your content in, followed by another empty column
			that is another twenty five percent (one quarter) in width. You may have
			noticed that this adds up to one hundred percent. This is important to
			remember when laying out your columns so that everything flows nicely
			together down the page.</p>
			
			<div class="note">
				<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <strong>pre</strong> will create empty
				space before the main column, and <strong>suf</strong> will create
				empty space after.</p>
			</div>
		
			<p>There are a few more paremeters you can use to give you even more control.
			<strong>dfirst</strong> will specify the first column in a row when displayed on a desktop, and remove
			any left padding, keeping the column vertically aligned with the left side
			of the page. You can also use this method for "nested" columns. Likewise
			<strong>dlast</strong> will remove the right padding. More control is given
			for this for Tablet and Mobile displays by using <strong>tfirst</strong>
			and <strong>mfirst</strong> as well as <strong>tlast</strong> and
			<strong>mlast</strong> respectively.</p>
			
			<p>Here is a complete list of available perameters and their possible values:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>grid</strong> - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
				75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 33, 66</li>
				<li><strong>tgrid</strong> - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
				75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 33, 66</li>
				<li><strong>mgrid</strong> - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
				75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 33, 66</li>
				<li><strong>pre</strong> - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
				75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 33, 66</li>
				<li><strong>suf</strong> - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,
				75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 33, 66</li>
				<li><strong>dfirst</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>tfirst</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>mfirst</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>dlast</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>tlast</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>mlast</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>dhide</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>thide</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>mhide</strong> - true, false</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Button Shortcodes</h2>
			<p>There is a simple button shortcode available to use should you
			wish to link to a specific article, page or use for an external link.
			Here's a basic example:</p>
			
<pre>
[button]

Your Content... (this is usually the button's label)

[/button]
</pre>
		
			<p>Between the opening and closing tags, you would normally put the
			button's label (e.g. "View Post"). Here is a more advanced example:</p>
			
<pre>
[button url="http://www.eaxmapleurl.com"]

Your Content... (this is usually the button's label)

[/button]
</pre>

			<p>This example will link to
			the URL specified in the <strong>url</strong> peramemter. Here are the
			complete list of perameters and their possible values:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>url</strong> - URL path (i.e. a web address)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Accordion Shortcode</h2>
			<p>This shortcode will allow you to display multiple accordions on one page. There is also the option to 
			make it into a toggle instead. Here's an example:</p>
			
<pre>
[acc title="Accordion Title" open="true" type="toggle"]

Your Content Here...

[/acc]
</pre>
		
			<p>This example will turn the "toggle" mode on and also make it "open" by default. The parameters and values are
			as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>title</strong> - Any string</li>
				<li><strong>open</strong> - true, false</li>
				<li><strong>type</strong> - toggle (leave blank for default behaviour)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Tabs Shortcodes</h2>
			<p>Tabs need to be grouped together in order to work properly, so this shortcode is a little more complicated.
			Take this example:</p>
			
<pre>
[tabs names="tab1:tab2:tab3"]

	[tab name="tab1"]

	Content for Tab One...

	[/tab]

	[tab name="tab2"]

	Content for Tab Two...

	[/tab]
	
	[tab name="tab3"]

	Content for Tab Three...

	[/tab]

[/tabs]
</pre>
		
			<p>The above code will generate three tabbed areas (tab1, tab2 and tab3), the main thing you need to remember
			here is that the names in the <strong>names</strong> parameter matches those in each "tab" name and that the
			names are seperated by a semi-colon (:).</p>

			<p>RoadRunners is compatible with the <strong>Contact Form 7</strong> plugin for when you need to add a
			functional contact form to the main homepage. In order to use this plugin, you must first install it. There are
			details on how to do this further up the page in the "Install Plugins" section.</p>
			<p>You may notice that adding a contact form is again, very similar to adding a normal post. Firstly, 
			navigate your way to the "Contact" page and you'll see that there is a demo contact form already
			available. You can either modify this, or create an entirely new one. It's completely up to you:</p>
			<img src="images/contact-01.jpg" alt="Contact Page" />
			
			<p>The following screenshot is a form that I built myself for the Demo site of this theme. As you
			can see, you can combine a mixture of HTML and the tags that are specific to each of the forms
			fields. To learn more about the tags and how to configure your contact form, please visit the
			plugins <a href="http://contactform7.com/getting-started-with-contact-form-7/" target="_blank">documentation page</a>.
			Once you have configured your form, simply copy and paste the shortcode into the <strong>Contact</strong> section of the Theme Options page
			(the field that says "Contact Form 7 Shortcode").</p>
