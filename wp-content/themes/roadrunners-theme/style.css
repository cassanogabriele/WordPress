Description: RoadRunners is a theme for Bands, Musicians and just about anything to do with music. It uses the popular "single page" layout and integrates some nice transition effects using the power of CSS. It works beautifully with WordPress' ability to embed audio and video into posts and pages. To get the most out of this theme, we recommend installing the complimentary RoadRunners Plugin so you can manage Artists and Events.
